     * one constructor argument (beaconAddress) which is already available in the
     * storage of the factory contract (VoucherHub).
     *
     * @dev By design, only 1 contract instance is created by wallet because of
     * the above. This is a business requirement.
     * The voucher type could be introduced to make it possible to have 1 instance
     * by wallet by type.
