### addEligibleAsset

```solidity
function addEligibleAsset(uint256 voucherTypeId, address asset) external
```

Add an eligible asset to a voucher type.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| voucherTypeId | uint256 | The ID of the voucher type. |
| asset | address | The address of the asset to add. |

### removeEligibleAsset

```solidity
function removeEligibleAsset(uint256 voucherTypeId, address asset) external
```

Remove an eligible asset to a voucher type.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| voucherTypeId | uint256 | The ID of the voucher type. |
| asset | address | The address of the asset to remove. |

### createVoucher

```solidity
function createVoucher(address owner, uint256 voucherType, uint256 value) external returns (address voucherAddress)
```

Create new voucher for the specified account and call initialize function.
Only 1 voucher is allowed by account. This is guaranteed by "create2" mechanism
and using the account address as salt.

_Note: the same account could have 2 voucher instances if the "beaconAddress"
changes, but this should not happen since the beacon is upgradeable, hence the
address should never be changed._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| owner | address | The address of the voucher owner. |
| voucherType | uint256 | The ID of the voucher type. |
| value | uint256 | The amount of SRLC we need to credit to the voucher. |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| voucherAddress | address | The address of the created voucher contract. |

### topUpVoucher

```solidity
function topUpVoucher(address voucher, uint256 value) external
```

Top up a voucher by increasing its balance and pushing its expiration date.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| voucher | address | The address of the voucher. |
| value | uint256 | The amount of credits to top up. |

### debitVoucher

```solidity
function debitVoucher(uint256 voucherTypeId, address app, uint256 appPrice, address dataset, uint256 datasetPrice, address workerpool, uint256 workerpoolPrice, uint256 volume) external returns (uint256 sponsoredAmount)
```

Debit voucher balance when used assets are eligible to voucher sponsoring.
(1) If this function is called by an account which is not a voucher,
it will have no effect other than consuming gas since balance would be
empty (tokens are only minted for vouchers).
(2) This function should not revert even if the amount debited is zero when
no asset is eligible or balance from caller is empty. Thanks to that it is
possible to try to debit the voucher in best effort mode (In short: "use
voucher if possible"), before trying other payment methods.

Note: no need for "onlyVoucher" modifier because if the sender is not a voucher,
its balance would be null, then "_burn()" would revert.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| voucherTypeId | uint256 | The type ID of the voucher to debit. |
| app | address | The app address. |
| appPrice | uint256 | The app price. |
| dataset | address | The dataset address. |
| datasetPrice | uint256 | The dataset price. |
| workerpool | address | The workerpool address. |
| workerpoolPrice | uint256 | The workerpool price. |
| volume | uint256 | Volume of the deal. |

### refundVoucher

### drainVoucher
